The methodology that will be used for this project is an agile-like one which is a mix of kanban/scrum.

### Backlog

The project planning consists of a backlog of all the features that are planned. Not all of the will become a reality because of time constraints but there will be a prioritization.

### Design of the app
The photo(s) below is the current design of the app. All of the UI is built from scratch using Sketch.
